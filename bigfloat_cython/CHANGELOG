Changes from bigfloat v0.2
--------------------------

- Rewrote core to use Cython rather than ctypes.

- mpfr module now separately available as an extension type, with semantics very close
  to the Mpfr library.

- Added bigfloat support for new rounding mode MPFR_RNDA (round away from zero).

- Rounding modes are now represented as named integers (instances of
  RoundingMode, an int subclass), rather than strings.  This allows them to be passed
  directly to Mpfr functions.

- Fixed a bug that meant old context wasn't restored when changing exponents
  with one valid exponent and one invalid. (eminmax)

- Many more docstrings than originally; better function signatures.

- Split out context, rounding_mode code into their own modules.
