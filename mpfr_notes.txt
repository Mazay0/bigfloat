Notes on using MPFR
-------------------

1. Should always have mpfr_emin <= mpfr_emax, else results may be undefined.

For example, if mpfr_emin > mpfr_emax then the only representable
values are zeros, infinities and nans.  But then nextbelow(+Inf) should
return 0.0.  It doesn't (at least in MPFR 2.4.1.)

Suggest adding a note to the docs saying that mpfr_emin <= mpfr_emax is
required.


2. mpfr_set_ui_2exp doesn't check bounds on exponents; can induce
undefined behaviour by taking exponent close to LONG_MAX.

On my (32-bit) machine:

mpfr_set_ui_2exp(x, 12345, LONG_MAX-10, RoundTiesToEven) gives
'Infinity' (correct), but a ternary value of 0 (incorrect);
mpfr_set_ui_2exp(x, 12345, LONG_MAX-14, RoundTiesToEven) is okay.
mpfr_set_ui_2exp(x, 12345, LONG_MAX-9, RoundTiesToEven) gives a result
of 0 (bad) and ternary value of -1.

(1st case gives the magic exponent corr. to infinity...)

Should document a range of exponents for which mpfr_set_ui_2exp is
guaranteed to work correcly.

3. mpfr_init_set, ... mpfr_init_set_f are macros.  Please document this.
(mpfr_init_set_str appears not to be a macro)
