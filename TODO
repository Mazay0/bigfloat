Implement __hash__ method for BigFloats
---------------------------------------
  This is a little tricky:
    - if the BigFloat is an integer, its hash should match that of the integer
    - if the BigFloat is exactly representable as a float, its hash should match
      that of the float
    - equal BigFloats (e.g., with different precisions but the same value)
      should hash equal.  Perhaps compute the hex string representation,
      remove trailing zeros, and get the hash of the result?
