Implement floordiv method for BigFloats
---------------------------------------
  x // y should behave as with any other operation or function, though
  the sign convention should match that of x % y:  that is, x // y
  should be the result of rounding the quotient towards zero.

  As with any function that produces a single MPFR result, it's enough
  to be able to compute with rounding mode RoundTowardZero and to be
  able to detect exactness.  It's the second part that's tricky here:
  floor(x / y) is exactly n iff n <= x // y < n + 1.  Since n may be
  something huge, n + 1 shouldn't be computed exactly (since this
  might involved billions of bits); instead we need to find an
  indirect way of doing this comparison.

Flags for subnormal numbers
---------------------------

  mpfr_subnormalize doesn't set the underflow and inexact flags
  appropriately;  we should do that.
