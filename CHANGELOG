What's new in bigfloat 0.2?
===========================

Library
-------

- The setup.py file no longer attempts to locate the MPFR library at
  install time.  The configuration file still exists, and can be edited
  to give a hard-coded location.  Alternatively, ctypes should find the
  library if it's within the usual library search paths.  (If not, it
  might be necessary to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.)
  
- Use a weakref callback to ensure mpfr_clear gets called, instead of
  relying on __del__.

- Make bigfloat compatible with versions of MPFR as far back as MPFR 2.3.0

- Relicense under LGPL, since this package might be considered a
  derived work of MPFR.

What's new in bigfloat 0.1.2?
