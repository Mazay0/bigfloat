The bigfloat module is a Python module providing arbitrary-precision
correctly-rounded floating-point arithmetic.  It's implemented as a wrapper
around the MPFR library (http://www.mpfr.org).

To install, execute the command:

python setup.py install

from the bigfloat-0.1/ directory.

This module requires Python 2.5 or later.  The MPFR and GMP libraries will
need to be already installed on your system.

If your MPFR library is located in an unusual place, or you have
multiple MPFR libraries installed on your system and you want to
specify which one to use, you may need to edit the bigfloat_config.py
configuration file.  You may also need to edit this file if the MPFR
or GMP libraries were built using a non-standard configuration.
